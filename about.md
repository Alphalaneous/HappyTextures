# Happy Textures :3

A Geometry Dash mod that brings texture packs to the next level!

## Features

- Replacing bigFont (Pusab) will not replace the font within levels.
- Fixed overlapping texture issues with CCScale9Sprite (Transparent textures in the level search look good now)
- Extensive Data Driven UI support with JSON
