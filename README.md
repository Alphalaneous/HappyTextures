# Happy Textures :3

A Geometry Dash mod that brings texture packs to the next level!

## Features

- Replacing bigFont (Pusab) will not replace the font within levels.
- Fixed overlapping texture issues with CCScale9Sprite (Transparent textures in the level search look good now)
- Fixed comment borders being ugly with certain texture packs
- Extensive Data Driven UI support with JSON

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Alphalaneous/HappyTextures/wiki) on how to use.
