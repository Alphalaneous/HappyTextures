# Happy Textures :3

A Geometry Dash mod that brings texture packs to the next level!

## Features

- Replacing bigFont (Pusab) will not replace the font within levels.
- Fixed overlapping texture issues with CCScale9Sprite(Transparent textures in the level search look good now)
- Extensive Data Driven UI support with JSON

## Data Driven UI

Geometry Dash UIs are unable to be modified without separate mods by default. This mod aims to resolve that issue, such that any texture pack can change UI elements easily. 

Within a texture pack, add a `ui` folder, this is where any UI modifications will go.

To help with the UI process, it is recommended to install the **DevTools** mod on Geode.

(Almost) every page on GD has an ID, you will want to create a JSON file with the format `ID.json` inside the ui folder to begin. Within DevTools, you can find this ID by going to the **Tree** tab, clicking on the CCScene dropdown to view the rest of the elements, and looking at IDs of the elements, in quotes, on that scene. For example, `MenuLayer.json` will be found on the main menu, which will be used as an example throughout the rest of this.

You can expand these elements in DevTools to find what you may want to modify. Example below

```
â–¼ [0] cocos2d::CCScene <1>
   â–¼ [0] MenuLayer "MenuLayer" <13>
      ðŸž‚ [0] MenuGameLayer "main-menu-bg" <17>
      â–¼ [1] cocos2d::CCMenu "main-menu" <3>
         ðŸž‚ [0] CCMenuItemSpriteExtra "icon-kit-button" <1>
         ðŸž‚ [1] CCMenuItemSpriteExtra "play-button" <1>
         ðŸž‚ [2] CCMenuItemSpriteExtra "editor-button" <1>
      ðŸž‚ [2] cocos2d::CCMenu "bottom-menu" <8>
      ...
```

Within MenuLayer, we can see there is a menu, the main menu, which has three buttons. Any or all of these buttons can be modified within that MenuLayer.json file. We would first want to get the main menu by grabbing the children of the MenuLayer, and finding the `"main-menu"` ID:

```json
{
    "children": {
        "main-menu":{

        }
    }
}
```

Any node can have it's own children, in this example, we grab the children of the main-menu if we want to get the buttons from within it:

```json
{
    "children": {
        "main-menu": {
            "children": {

            }
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can select all the children of a node with `"all-children"` instead of `"children"`.

Let's say we want to edit the play button, and scale it to twice it's original size, we would get the `"play-button"` child of the main-menu and then edit it's `"attributes"`:

```json
{
    "children": {
        "main-menu": {
            "children": {
                "play-button": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "scale": 2
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

There are a lot of attributes you can use, and they will be listed at the end of this page. 

Some attributes only work if you are selecting a **CCSprite** or a **CCMenuItemSpriteExtra**. These attributes are `"sprite"` and `"sprite-frame"` which take in any image or a frame of an existing spritesheet. 

When it comes to using the position attribute, you can change the x and y coordinates, which will place them at those exact coordinates on the screen no matter what, or you can choose a `"relative"` position, which makes x and y modifiy that. A relative position can be something such as `"center"` to place something directly in the center of the screen, or `"top-right"` to place something at the top right of the screen.
